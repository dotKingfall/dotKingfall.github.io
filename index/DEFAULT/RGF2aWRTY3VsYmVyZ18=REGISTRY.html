	 <h4 style = "font-family:fantasy;"> Actually it's not a beautiful story or anything

	<p style = "font-style: italic">
	 Some could say it is a sad story, indeed.<br>
	 Did you know after war ended there was still some who
	 stayed in the space?<br>
	 I guess don't, since that information was concealed.<br>
	 You may think these are just fantasies
	 of a retired man whose life is about to end,<br>
	 but I'd like to tell you one particular story, if I may.<br>
	</p>	
	<p style = "font-style: italic">
	 Back then, when the war was still on its middle,
	 a group of soldiers fell into a uncharted ground.<br>
	 Of couse they wouldn't just sit there and wait for death.<br>
	 It was the fate of most of them, though.<br>

		<h3>First Delusion</h3>
		<p style = "font-style: italic">
		 Right after they'd fallen, when still in a bewildered state -like I said,<br>
		 in the middle of the war-, this meaning no great amount of oxygen, food supply or<br>
		 anything else they needed, things were only getting worse.
		</p>
		<p style = "font-style: italic">
		 They were a great and large fleet of 5400 humans, but some died in the explosion. Others,<br>
		 'cause of the collision, and even some of bleeding. They were reducted to fewer<br>
		 than seven hundred. And of course, that's not all!
		</p>
		<p style = "font-style: italic">
		 They could easily identify that something was wrong if they've calmed themselves. In a era were the space were<br> filled with humans- including fighting each other-, when a totally unexplored planet appears before you,<br>
		 specially in a area so well-knowed by the humanitiy, even so they chose it to battle<br>
		 it is a big surprise when something like that happens, of course!
		</p>
		<p style = "font-style: italic">
		 The soldiers had some strange kind of diseases, biological reactions to the knew nature, and furthermore.<br>
		 Instead of calming theirselves, do you know what they did? They separed into groups!<br>
		 Now, the seven-hundred army was even lower than that. And they started to kill themselves.
		</p>
		<p style = "font-style: italic">
		 The bigger against the lower and the lower against the big ones. You know, in the end, only those who<br>
		 preferred to avoid that slaughter were spared. Generically speaking.<br>
		 In the end, the bigger group was a cooperative made of rookies and led by a corporal.

		<h3>Second Delusion</h3>
	</center>
		<p>
		 Emma- Why da heck are we following this boy? I bet he doesn't even know where we're goin'!<br>
		 Lukus- Hey hey sweetie, calm down! you're wasting our dear oxygen<br>
		 Joseph- I bet she's prepared to wast her energy beating us too, Lukus<br>
		 Stain- Oh, the girl these days, don't ya think, Jonathan?<br>
		 Jonathan- Hm?<br>
		 Emma- Boi, I thought you were the leader here, why are we being led by Joseph?<br>
		</p>
		<p style = "font-style: italic">
		 Still they were in a danger zone, the tension were making 'em lose their mind. They knew not what were<br>
		 to happen to them. Nor what has happend to others. They were really going to survive?<br>
		 A handful amount of questions with no sign of answers. And the most of them begun to discuss.<br>
		</p>
	</center>
		David- But Emma--<br>
		Emma- You shut up, naivie!<br>
		Daniela- Emma, please...<br>
	<center>
		<p style = "font-style: italic">
		And then Jonathan took out the gun. He pointed it to Emma and said:
		</p>
	</center>
		[Emma and Daniela]- !<br>
		Jonathan- You. "Naivie" little girl. I commend you to stay quiet for now. We don't know where to go, I couldn't<br>
		care less about who is on the lead as long as we survive. Our food is almost at the end, we ran out of water<br>
		and the last thing we need now is a soldier yelling all around and maybe the rest of our <b>short</b> lives atracting<br>
		all kind of undentified and maybe dangerous creatures. Let's survive first, shall we?<br>
		Emma- I--... Sigh, okay, sorry "big boss"<br>
		<center>
		 <p style = "font-style: italic">
			Hahaha, he was like, always short temper! Well, quite a nice guy though, I guess you'll like him later.<br>
			but, solved that matter for the time being, they have a new concern now. They were low on food,<br>
		    did ran out on water and did not now what is dangerous or not, and soon enough some other matters concern<br>
		    the soldiers would appear again. And everything would be alright if this was a nice story, but... They didn't find anything.

		<h3>Third Delusion</h3>
		<p style = "font-style: italic">
		 And thus two more days had passed
		</p>
	</center>
	<p>
		Saturno- W-wait everyone... I can't walk anymore<br>
		[Everyone stops]<br>
		Lukus- Come on girl, we're also almost dying here<br>
		Emma- Boi, you lack chivalry<br>
		Lukus- Also energy, water, food, and particularly patience, ma'am<br>
		[Some time later, in the remains of the ship]<br>
		Lukus- Well, no sign of water or something, big boss<br>
		Jonathan- What's with that name now?<br>
		Charlotte-... Be sincere with us, Jonathan, is this your fault?<br>
		[The most of them]- !<br>
		Jonathan- Sigh... an' there we go<br>
		Charlotte- I--<br>
		Jonathan- Yeah, yeah, I know, I know<br>
		[While they are at it:]<br>
		Daniela- What are they talking about?<br>
    	Saturno- Don't ya know? Jonathan was almost a marshal and then suddenly he crumbled down till corporal<br>
    	Emma- Daheck, is this even possible? What did he do?<br>
    	Saturno- No idea. I guess nobody here knows the why<br>
    	[Going back:]<br>
    	Jonathan-Yeah boi, yeah, I got it already, stop whining<br>
    	Stain- Cut the crap boi! [Thrust Jonathan] We'd not be in this shitty situation if it's not because of you!<br>
    	Jonathan- Oh, now I get why were you trying to get rid of me tonight. Makes sense.<br>
    	[Everyone]- !<br>
    	Medemoir- Wait, what? Were you guys trying to kill one of us?<br>
    	Alberto- What do you know? If we kill him now maybe we can get out of here<br>
    	Emma- Hey man, let's calm down and--<br>
    	Stain- You talking 'bout calming down, <b>whore?</b>
    	Emma- Hey you--<br>
    	[Victor shots up]<br>
    	[Everyone looks toward him]<br>
    	Victor- Stop being stupid, kids<br>
    	Emma- I'm older than you, boy<br>
    	Victor- Blame on him or not, he being killed decreases our chance to survive either<br>
    	Stain- Stop using our precious bullets, you damn punk<br>
    	Jonathan-... Lemme explain to ya some things, will ya?<br>
    	[Everyone stay quiet]<br>
    	Jonathan- You can follow that guy's line of thought and kill me [points to Stain].<br>
    	And later you die in this planet.<br>
    	You can follow me and still die also.<br>
    	Or, luckily, follow me and some of you survive<br>
    	Stain- Hah, there we are! You want to kill those of us because we're--<br>
    	[Emma shuts up Stain]<br>
    	Emma-... Are there no options where everyone can go home?<br>
    	Jonathan- That one is lost since we fell here and lost almost five thousand guys<br>
    	Emma-... And we'll go out of the battleship?<br>
    	Jonathan- Yeah<br>
    	Emma- How can you be so sure?<br>
    	Jonathan- I can, but not you.<br>
    	Emma- What?<br>
    	Jonathan- I can have all confidence I want, but how can you know I'm right? You don't know if I<br>
    	can fulfill anything I'm saying. We all can still die. Go with the other side if you want protection<br>
    	inside of this falling battleship. If ya want to have a chance of survive, come with me<br>
    	and bet your life in this gamble. I can't predict the future, anyway.<br>
    	Emma... Okay, I'll go with you<br>
    	Daniela- What? You are really going with this guy?<br>
    	Emma- Don' know of ya, Daniela, but I prefer to be with this guy and his amusing talk<br>
    	Stain- He who pointed a gun towards you? Hah, what a confidence it gave me to go with you!<br>
    	Emma- And wouldn't you do the same thing on my back?<br>
    	Stain- Tryin' to save all of us, of course!<br>
    	Saturno- Girl, you really are nuts like him<br>
    	Emma- There are no rules here. I can possibly be doing the worst choice I've ever did in my entire life.<br>
    	Jonathan- Oh, that touched my heart<br>
    	Emma- Shaddap<br>
		but I don't care. You choose it or not, none of us have surety of what we're doin'.<br>
		Alberto- Still we can be safer here in the battleship<br>
		Joseph- Of course, we need a safe place to die of hungry. Also I don't believe in you guys.

				Said him while walking towards Jonathan and Emma.<br>
				After that, they chose whom to believe. Pariticularly,<br>
				they had no reason to believe in Jonathan's story. He could be just saying<br>
				nonsense to escape death or something. Yet, I guess every one who stay'd with him was because<br>
				the words he said were filled with surety. And now they were about to know more about this "surety"<br>
				Or maybe insanity. Careless, or precisely, according to him, fear.

		The war now is nothing to them. In fact, they were so occupied trying to survive that<br>
		it was of no concern what could happen if they make that out alive. If they would be considered a renegade<br>
		or if they would be found by his enemies. Is fair to not think in these things when they had that big of a<br>
		problem to solve now. The fights between themselves were just making it worse. They were mentally and<br> phisically destroyed and even still, they would not have mercy upon them, would they?<br>
		Oh, yeah, we had no mercy. No rest. And still we could glance at Jonathan and have a bit more of confidence.<br>
		A bit more of courage. And he, who does he had? Well, he had no one. But he was still to discover that.<br>
		Oh... I lost my composure a bit here, sorry for that.<br>

		<h3>Fourth Delusion</h3>
		<p style = "font-style: italic">
		 Jonathan and his crew separated and departed from the group some time hence. None can't really tell you<br>
		 how many hours had passed or something. Their source of warmth wasn't the sun and for many, <b>many</b> other reasons<br> Their ways to localizate or count the time weren't working
		</p>
	</center>
	<p>
	 Daniela- Oh my, oh my, I can't believe I came along with you guys<br>
	 David- I have the same feeling, I guess?<br>
	 Daniela- Oh... Come to think in it, what's your name, peewee?<br>
	 Victor- Pfft...<br>
	 David- Hey...<br>
	 Victor- Looks like this'll be a amusing trip till death<br>
	 Daniela- Don't jinx it this way<br>
	 [While:]<br>
	 Emma- Big boi, what do we do now? Where walking nowhere?<br>
	 Jonathan-... We're getting food<br>
	 Emma- WHAT?<br>
	 [Daniela and David stops and look at them]<br>
	 Daniela- What's happening you two?<br>
	 Emma- How do ya know where to find food?<br>
	 Jonathan- Well, I gathered<br>
	 Emma- This is our fourth day without food. And the second one with no water! And you say you have food just now?<br>
	 Jonathan- Don't think much of it, naivie. We have just nine days of food for you<br>
	 Daniela- And yours is granted forever:<br>
	 Jonathan- Probably<br>
	 Daniela- Obviously I guee. You cunning guy.<br>
	 Jonathan- Let's get the food. I have water also, but nothing to be proud of. Two days for us or something.<br>
	 After that I'll tell you some things that probably will interest ya. Follow me for now<br>
	 [Jonathan start walking]<br>
	 [Everyone]-...<br>
	</p>
	<center>
		<p style = "font-style: italic">
		 The confidence they first had in that mysterious guy was decreasing. Fortunately to all of 'em, they soon found the food.<br>
		</p>
	</center>
	<p>
	 [Everyone astonished]<br>

	 Joseph- Well... he... Really has food<br>
	 Emma- Wow...<br>
	 Jonathan- In case you don't know, jst saying: Eat no more than necessary.<br>
	 [After a time]<br>
	 Jonathan- After I'll be back we'll talk [Drinking water]<br>
	</p>
	<center>
		<p style = "font-style: italic">
		 He had some tents ready and some other step. The food were inside of some of 'em. The water was outside.
		</p>
	</center>
	<p>
	 Daniela- What is taking so long to him?<br>
	 Joseph- Do ya think 'im could be targeting us?<br>
	 David- He could be dead you know<br>
	 Emma- That makes no sense, Jospeh<br>
	 Victor- I agree<br>
	 David- What did ye say dat?<br>
	 Victor- You know... if he had cover ups they would not be so far. Also we stayed many time<br>
	 with the food. Why take that risk?<br>
	 Joseph- Oh... Makes sense... I guess...<br>
	 Jonathan- You can't lay down your guard here, bois<br>
	 Daniela- Man, waht were you doing? I thought you'd abandon'd us<br>
	 Jonathan- After show you the food? No way<br>
	 Emma- Hah. Wha--... What you... Jonathan?<br>
	 Victor- Hm? What's with you two? Something like couple mood?<br>
	 David- Of course Victor, I bet you're right<br>
	 Emma-... D'dya killed 'em?<br>
	 Jonathan- A hell of a good sight you have<br>
	 [Everyone]- ??<br>
	 Jonathan- But actually I just came out to look for food<br>
	 Emma- <b>You. Have. FOOD HERE, BOI</b><br>
	 Victor- Hey people? What's with you two?<br>
	 Daniela- Calm down, Emma! What's wrong with you!<br>
	 Emma- THAT ASS ATE A DEAD BODY!<br>
	 Victor- WHAT?!<br>
	 Jonathan- Well, that's how it is<br>
	 David- What the...
	 [Joseph get away from Jonathan]<br>
	</p>
	<center>
		<p style = "font-style: italic">
		 He was always trying to protect us from everything worse than we already were. A fella with a hard-as-rock head.<br>
		 Due our greeness in almost everytihin we did in life compared to 'im, we almost never were able to do anything for him<br>
		</p>
	</center>
	<p>
	 Jonathan- Let's get going, shall we?<br>
	 Daniela- Wait, what?? Of course no!<br>
	 Emma-... It doesn't matter since we'll probably be dead<br>
	 Victor- What?<br>
	 Emma- Sigh.. I missed the food could just be poisoned<br>
	 Joseph- No... I don't--<br>
	 Jonathan- Daheck are you guys saying? Stop panicking, that's cringe<br>
	 Daniela- Well, <b>YOU</b> have no right to say anything, sir!<br>
	 Joseph- I... I at least will.. [Takes out the gun]<br>
	 Jonathan- Emma, calm this guy and let's talk. This is your fault after all<br>
	 Emma- MINE?<br>
	 Jonathan- Well, you said that about that food. I'll be waiting in the bigger tent<br>
	 Joseph- No... WAIT! I WILL--<br>
	 [Emma punches Joseph]<br>
	 Emma- <b>Get yourself together, boi</b> 
	 [And then later:]<br>
	 Daniela- What do you think we should do?<br>
	 David- Well... after that much time we're still fine, so... It's fine, I guess? Let's talk to him<br>
	 Emma- That's not the problem here...<br>
	 Joseph-... I... don't trust this guy<br>
	 Emma- Wow, great discovery big boi! Of course no one does so!<br>
	 David- Since he said he'll be telling we some things, what do you think about we just ask?<br>
	 Daniela- You're too careless and innocent, peewee. What are you doing in the army?<br>
	 David- Shaddap<br>
	 Victor- I guess that--<br>
	 Jonathan- Bois, what a delay it is!<br>
	 [Everyone stays in guard]<br>
	 Jonathan- Glad to know you followed my teaching<br>
	 Emma-... SIGH... That carefree buddies...<br>
	 Jonathan- Glad to know you calmed down<br>
	 Daniela-... And? Why did you do that? We have food here<br>
	 Jonathan- Exactly 'cause of that, little princess.<br>
	 Joseph- You're making no sense!<br>
	 Jonathan- I need you alive, bois<br>
	 Daniela- And 'cause of that you'll be going to eat people?<br>
	 Jonathan- Didn't I said'ya? We have 9 days of food for you<br>
	 Daniela- And that's what I'm saying, we have foo--<br>
	 Jonathan- Sigh... Do you know how many days with food will be decreased if I eat along?<br>
	 Daniela-............... Well, I understando your point, but--<br>
	 Emma- And if you get sick?<br>
	 Jonathan- I'll probably die<br>
	 Emma-...<br>
	 Jonathan- We are in a situation where none can have mercy. Just enjoy your food, will ye?<br>
	 Victor- No mercy? You saying that?<br>
	 Jonathan- I presume you don't know what could happen if you eat a dead human body for the first time<br>
	 [Everyone]-...<br>
	 Jonathan- Thought so. They don't teach that in the school. I already said that, I need you alive.<br>
	 If one of you die, our morale will decrease, our job will increase, and so on<br>
	 David- And... If you die?<br>
	 Jonathan- Huh? That matters?<br>
	 [Everyone]- !<br>
	 Jonathan- You know, if I'd die, I'd be just a "guy" who ate corpses, wouldn't I? How on the world would that<br>
	 affect you? If that happens into the eight more days you have with food, feel free<br>
	 to go back to the battleship, to impart or to wait the food and water ends. That's how it is.<br>
	 [Everyone]-...<br>
	 Jonathan- I'll be entering the tent. No certain types of radiation, come along if you want.<br>
