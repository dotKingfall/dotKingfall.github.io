					 Oh no, user! Something went wrong!<br>
					 Actually we know what happened, but we have told you, haven't we?
					 But no worries, we are already fixing it! I would like you to be more careful next time!
					 I'm almost sure you won't, but please have mercy on us!.
					 If you don't, well, this is life.
				</p>

				<p>
					 Oh, by the way, what do you think about what 01010011 00101101 01000110 01101001 01110010 01110011 01110100 said?
					 I saw it was talking to you last time and I don't know why but some other...<br><br>
					 Oh, wait...<br><br>
					 Okay, while we were trying to restore the page you were looking for... we discovered... tan dun dun dun
					 duuuuuuuun... that there is no page!. No page, no website... nothing! And you know what it means?
					 YES! That you can't read any of the files because they are no more! Well, this is at least what I thought... But
					 you know, there is one, just one thing left. Looks like our--... oh... wel... uh... I don't know how to go on
					 with this... Wait a bit... Oh yes, he's marvelous, even prepared one to me!<br><br>
					 Cough cough, I mean...<br>
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bolder;" class="words">
					 What an eyesore. It has gone so far astray. I will give him chance, and yet, he won't choose to listen to me.
					 I suppose it will happen over and over again. And still, there is no need for me to intervene again, for
					 I already have one to know these things.<br><br>
					 Furthermore,<br>
					 [∞] has deleted some of this my creation. This [00110001] will eventually show you these parts. I will, for now,
					 not deal with him. Neither will I unto you say again by now. Farewell.
				</p>

				<p>
					 Now, now.<br>
					 I didn't expect things to unravel this way. Nice to meet you? I don't know what to say in this kind
					 of situation. Well, it's like you've heard. The page wasn't turned off at all, but forcibly turned down
					 by [∞]. What a plot twist to me! I mean, Now all that before makes sense! But well, I'll give to you
					 the last action that I received related to you by now.
				</p>

				<p>
					 It is in a simple place. You won't take too long finding it, that's why it is so simple. Because
					 [∞] shall not intervene. I shall not intervene. In the error, you shall find the exit of
					 this world. There, you can learn the truth. Only [He] has power there. Found it.<br><br>
					 Find BlackOne.
