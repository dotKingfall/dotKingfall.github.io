	 	After my father's disappearance and my mother's death I didn't know things were only meant to go downhill this way.<br>I have always been harassed for everyone as a "traitor" because of my grandpa's actions. Also because of this, they<br>did nothing about me mother's murder and murderer. He was applauded anyway. I live at the countryside. Alone. Yet,<br>I have to keep myself moving because they're watching over me any time, i can't really sleep. I also have insomnia<br>because of this. Shucks, I'm already out of patience. Couldn't they jus disappear? I just--... I just wanted a peaceful life!<br> am I asking for this much?!<br>
	 	But anyway, recently I started to read my grandpa's diaries. I found a very interesting thing. It's a technology I have<br> never saw before. I always loved technology, so obviously I would be interested in this. This is my only comfort,<br> since I can carry it on my pocket, or else, would be destroyed like all the photographs and<br>
	 	other memories I had with my parents and my grandpa. Maybe call 'im "grandpa" seems a little childish, since<br>
	 	I'm 19 already, but I don't really care anyway<br>

	 x- Where are they? (*Refering to their persecutors)<br>
	 y- About six hundred lightyears behind us<br>
	 x- About 6,2 minutes?<br>
	 y- I love how you are accurate<br>
	 x- Kill 'em? (*Refering to the guys chasing our protagonist)<br>
	 y- Just make 'em run, if possible<br>
	 x- If not?<br>
	 y- ...The sixth and run is our priority. Just make it fast whatever the outcome may be.<br>

	<p>
	 x- We're in. Go. [Talking through the radio]<br>
	 y- Okay, madam [Talking through the speaker]<br>
	 - What... are you... [Falls asleep]<br>
	</p>
	<center>
		[Some time later...]
	</center>
	<p>
	 - Argh... Where do I... [Remembering what has happened]<br>
	 x- Good to see you well, sixth [Sarcastic smile]<br>
	 - Well... miss? It didn't see this way earlier<br>
	 x- Sorry for dat. We were pretty much dead if I have waited more.<br>
	 y- Oh... So this is David's grandson...
	 <center>
	 	[The two of them look towards him]
	 </center>
	 <br>
	 - And you..?<br>
	 y- Chandler. Chandler Enzo Alimaer. The Second.<br>
	 -Oh... Got it...<br>
	 x- It is a strange name indeed. You'll get used to it eventually.<br>
	 - Hm? What do you mean?<br>
	 Chandler- You're coming with us, of course. We can't let the Kingdom put their hands on you. You are our sixth!<br>
	 - ...<br>
	</p>
	 <center>
	 	<br>
	 	<font size="2" style="font-family: cursive;">
	 	 Well... I guess it's not worse than my previously <b>entire</b> life...
	 	</font>
	 </center>
	<p>
	  Chandler- We won't force you, if you don't want to, but at least try to hear us out.<br>
	  - ... Okay.
	</p>
	 <center>
	 	<font size="2" style="font-family: cursive;">
	 	 I don't really have much to be worried if they were plaining to kill me. But...
	 	</font>
	 </center>
	<p>
	 - Mind to tell me why all of this?<br>
	 x- Well... Our boss made a fuss some time ago and... [Looking at Chandler]<br>
	 - ... [Nod]<br>
	 x- Now they were going to kill you for sure and something like that [Chandler nodded in agreement]<br>
	 - ...
	</p>
	<center>
	 	<font size="2" style="font-family: cursive;">
	 	 Don't think they're lying, still something is not right, I guess... Maybe it's just the feeling of being kidnapped. You never know.
	 	</font>
	</center>
	 <br>
	<p>
	 - I guess I get your point. But are you doing this only because of my grandpa?<br>
	 x- ... pfft<br>
	 - ...<br>
	 x- Sorry, sorry, it was cute. Well, kinda like that<br>
	 - Yeah, yeah. By the way, what do you mean with "fuss" before?<br>
	</p>
	<br>
	<center>
	 	<font size="2" style="font-family: cursive;">
	 	 That geezer giving us problems even after death... Sigh, really my grandpa, I see<br>
	 	</font>
	</center>
	 <br>
    <p>
     x- Actually he caused so much attention recently because he destroyed a Kingdom's mothership just like that,<br>
     and because of that, to prevent risks, they'd probably would try to kill you now, before you met with us. Or at least<br>
     something worse than that.<br>
     - ... Okay, I believe in you. But why now? Why did your... "boss"? did it now?<br>
     x- No idea.<br>
     - What?<br>
     Chandler- Well, you'll understand soon, It'll be a long talk you'll have, so by now, let's first go to a safer place.<br>
     <br>
    <center>
     	[Then he left the room]
    </center>
    <br>
    <center>
    	[Some time of silence]
    </center>
    <br>
    <p>
     - Safer place huh...<br>
     x- Don't expect much. We're at war, anyway.<br>
     - Do we!?<br>
     x- Of course!<br>
     - ...
     x- Well, at least a bit [smiling]<br>
     <br>
     <center>

     		I... oh, nevermind, I won't even try to ratiocinate anymore...<br>
     	</font>
     </center>
     <br>
     x- ... Hey, you know something about your core?<br>
     - Hm? What is this?<br>
     x- Fufufu... nothing huh? Well, I need to keep expectations on, then<br>
     - Hn? About what--<br>
     Chandler- If I let you continue our greenie may be turned into a redie later~~ [smiling]<br>
	 - Eh...<br>
	 x- Stop it, Chandler... and you're done already?<br>
	 	 <br>
	 <center>
	 	<font size="2" style="font-family: cursive;">
	 		What does he mean?
	 	</font>
	 </center>
	 Chandler- I was just checking outside, lovies<br>
	 x- Sigh...<br>
 	</p>
 	<br>
	<center>
	 	<br>
	 	<font size="2" style="font-family: cursive;">
	 	 Since when he were there? I heard nothing from the ground<br>(*The ground was of metal and produced many echoes, which he had heard when Chandler left)<br>

	</center>
	 <br>
	 x- Well... [Getting up]<br>
	 My name is Emilia Grace. 25. [Offering hand for shaking]. I didn't have said it yet, right?<br>
	 - Florence Donatello Scullberg [Shaking hands]<br>
	 Emilia- Well, so let's keep goin'?<br>
	 Florence- Hn? To where?<br>
	 Chandler- Let's meet the other three, greenie.<br>
	 Florence- What? am I part of this, already?<br>
	 Emilia- Hahaha, Good to work with you, Don<br>
	 Chandler- It's time for you to start playing, big boy<br>
	 Florence-...<br>

	  After a lot of time walking
	</p>
	 Florence- ... Eh... so, what type of things you want me to do?<br>
	 Chandler- We just need you to survive<br>
	 Florence- Eh? Just this?<br>
	 Chandler- Well, I don't think you're a professional in being a criminal [Smiling]<br>
	 Florence- You never know, I guess<br>
	<p align="center">

	<p align="center">
	 (Then they go all the way through a metal pipe until they fall into a inflatable mattress)

	 	(*They were waiting)

	 Florence- !
	 <br><br>

	 What an absolutely stunning woman... wow... I thought these types were only for movies<br>
	 </font>
	</center>
	<br>
	 z- [Offering him a hand to get up]<br>
	 Florence- ... oh.. oh!, sorry [Accepts the help]<br>
	 z- Well, First of all, lemme apologize by the way you were brought here. You know, they can see us from the space,<br>
	 hear us in the surface from their ships, see even the insides of the planet itself, and so on. So it's a costume here<br>
	 not to come immeiately, but be wandering around a bit, and just then come here. You'll learn more about this process furhtermore.<br>
	 Here is an exception to all this, of course. They will teach you later, as I have said. Just know you can call me, if anything happens.<br> I'll also prepare your teleportation place, so then we don't need to use the mattress anymore.<br>
	 Florence- Oh, thanks<br>
	 z- [Appointing to Florence's jacket pocket]<br>
	 Florence- ?<br>
	 z- After you're done with all these things, come to my office. I'll open the core for you later.<br>
	 Florence- Huh? Do you mean you know how to... use it?<br>
	 z- Yeah. Left by your grandfather, right? I'll teach you some things about yours later too.<br>
	 Florence- Wow, that's quite a lot of things you're doing. Thanks<br>
	 z- Don't mind it<br>
	 Florence- And what is your name?<br>
	 z- You can call me anything you want, but normally the people here call me "Doctress"<br>
	 Florence- Doctress?<br>
	 Chandler- Something like "Doctor" plus "Mistress". My idea<br>
	 	 <br>
	 <center>
	  <font size="2" style="font-family: cursive;">
	 	Oh, why am I not surprised Chandler, Why am I not.<br>

	 [Florence thinks her pronounce is kinda cute, though not like to being called "newbie" or "greenie" all the time]
	</p>
	 x- Anyway, my name is Lisandra Adams. They call me Lisa for short. Fifth aaaaaaand, nineteen.<br>
	 Florence- Florence Scullberg. Sixth, as you shall know well. Also nineteen<br>
	 Chandler- What? No Donatello now?<br>
	 Emilia- Oh please, Chandler...<br>
	 Chandler- Oh, sorry<br>
     Lisa- ...[Smile], well, that bad tempered here is the fourth. his name is--<br>
     y- <b>James William</b>. Welcome, Florence. Fourth.<br>
     Lisa- ... as he said.<br>
     Florence- Well... So I presume Doctress is the first?<br>
     Emilia- Nope. She's just here. Not part of us.<br>
     Florence- What? I mean... Excuse me, what?<br>
     James- She was here before everyone else. Nobody really knows who she is<br>
     Florence- Bois... You are -<b>legally</b>-, something like terrorists and you're leaving her be without know who she is??<br>
     Chandler- Well, what a great opportunity it is. Since the first isn't here to talk to you, let's talk about certain issues<br>
     concerning... our "team", shall we?<br>

	 Emilia- Since there's nothing more to do here, we're taking our leave<br>
	 Florence- Already?<br>
	 Lisandra- Actually, except for Emilia and Chandler, all of us were in some another mission. We're here just to see you,<br> so naturally it's time to get back to work [Smiling]<br>
	 James- It's difficult for all of us to be here at the same time, y'know<br>

	 Chandler- Let's start talking a bit about us. Why do you tink we are here?<br>
	 Florence- Sincerely I have no idea. But at least now I have a reason to stay here.<br>
	 Chandler- Your grandfather's core?<br>
	 Florence- Yep<br>
	 Chandler- All of those kids were molested by the Kingdom's way of make things.<br>
	 Florence- What do you mean?<br>

     Chendler- I bet you do. They would never let you rest in peace.<br>
     Florence- Yeah...<br>
     Chandler- All my country was taken off because a criminal was makin' a hideaway there.<br>
     Emilia had her younger brother decapitaded and she was raped because the soldiers were too bored. He was<br>
     trying to save her and hit a "big guy" of the army.<br>
     Florence- !!!!!<br>
     Chandler- James' sister had a similar experience to Emilia. She had the same ending while James and her fiancé were<br> tied watching it all. Without can do nothing. Obligated to see that scene for the amusement of the guys there.<br>
     Lisandra's father had his head post in a stake because he criticized the Kingdom's actions.<br>
     Florence- I...<br>
     Chandler- Tell me Donatello, do you know what happend to your parents?<br>
     Florence- !<br>
     Chandler- Well, you can ask Doctress, if you don't know.<br>
     Florence- W-wait, wait, why don't you say to me now?<br>
     Chandler- Because we are not "they", greenie. We said it ourselves. But she was watching over you since a longe time ago,<br> maybe she knows of something. We do not spy on our teammates.<br>
     Florence- ... Thanks<br>
     Chandler- What?<br>
     Florence- For letting me be here. I really can't--<br>
     Chandler- Hey, what is done is done. We rescued you so what happened to us will not happen to you in a worse way.<br>
     Just help us do the same with everyone else.<br>
     Florence- ... Thank you<br>
     Chander- Ah the kids those days... well, Let's end this topic, won't we? I'll teach you about the numbers.<br>
     In the past, Joanathan Ortoggan was First, Victor Pluto was Second, Emma Isabella was Third, Joseph Memento was Fourth,<br> your grandmother, Daniela Eztinasi was Fifth and your grandfather, David Scullberg, was the Sixth. It was to rank power.<br>
     Florence- Wow, so he was the weakest! Haha, just like him indeed<br>
