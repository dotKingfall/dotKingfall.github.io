	  [Right after Chandler had left]<br><br>
	 	<font size="2" style="font-family: cursive;">
	 		Nightmare?
	 	</font>
 </center>
	 x- Okay then, follow me.<br>
	 Florence- Oh, okay
 <br><p align="center">
 	[They start walking]
 </p><br>
 	x- My name is Melissa Stephens. Actually the First, pleased to meet you.<br>
 	Florence- Florence Donatello Sculblerg. The sixth, I guess?<br>
 	Melissa- You bet haha<br>
 	Florence- So to where are we goin'?<br>
 	Melissa- Kitchen. I do prefer talk to you while eating, don't ya?<br>
 	Florence- Oh, right...<br><br>
	<center>
	 	<font size="2" style="font-family: cursive;">
	 		Talking 'bout that I'm hungry too, 'don't even know when was the last time I ate something.<br>
	 	</font>
	   <br>[They start to snack at the food]<br> [Florence starts to eat kind fast]<br>
	</center>
	<br>
	 Melissa- Wow, the food won't run away boy [smiling]<br>
	 Florence- Oh, sowwy... [Talking wiht the mouth full]<br>
	 Melissa- [Staring at him] [Smiling]<br>
	 Florence- [Blushing]<br>
	 Melissa- Hahahahaha<br>
	 Florence- P-please.. [Cleaning the mouth]<br>
	 Melissa- Sorry, sorry.<br>
	 Florence- ...~~<br>
	 Melissa- Well? Do you  have liked our team?<br>
	 Florence- Actually I have never been treated this fine by except my parents and grandfather.<br>
	<center>
	 	<font size="2" style="font-family: cursive;">
	 		Don't think it's really a good idea say much by now, but it's true they treated me well...<br>
	 		even annoying me sometimes, so I guess it's fair
	 	</font>
	 		<br>
	</center>
	 Melissa- You remind me of my husband. He was a carefree soldier and never acted like a king should haha<br>
	 Florence- Wow, so you were a Queen? How old are--... sorry<br>
	 Melissa- No problem at all. I'm thirty eight years-old already<br>
	 Florence- How did you met?<br>
	 Melissa- Are you asking this because of the age difference between us?<br>
	 Florence- Ah, no, no. I was just thinking if all of you were also kidnapped by someone or something like this<br>
	 Melissa- Originally we didn't plan on involving you like this.<br>
	 Florence- Yeah, Emilia told me something like that. You were doing a ruckus, right?<br>
	 Melissa- Me? No, I didn't do anything. You must be talking 'bout Jonathan.<br>
	 Florence- You're not the boss? Where is he then?<br>
	 Melissa- Dunno. Doctress says he left after making the First Order.<br>
	 Florence- First Order? How Doctress know this?<br>
	 Melissa- Like we call Nightmare's first generation. We also don't know how she knows it, since<br>
	 no generation data has this information. She frequently gives us new information.<br>
	 Florence- Oh, I thought this one was the first. We are called "Nightmare"? You know anything more<br>
	 about the Doctress?<br>
	 Melissa- Oficially yes. But normally calls us traitors, the seven, those damn guys, bandits, criminals and so on.<br> About Doctress... we have no data about her since the First Order. We don't even know when she came.<br>
	 Florence- A mysterious woman... do you guys entrust her?<br>
	 Melissa- Yeah. You know, the First Order was the weakest. The Second henceforth, it depends on user's abilities with the core.<br>Later Doctress will tell you about that. But anyway, they were chosen by their abilities and reliance and had no core.<br> All of them is activated by blood.<br><br>
	<center>
		[Taking something of her pocket]
	</center><br>
	 Melissa- See this? This is a core. Yours must be a bit different.<br>
	 Florence- Yeah [Taking off his core from his jacket pocket] [Put it on the table]<br>
	 Melissa- To activate this and initiate your weapon you need to have blood.<br>
	 Florence- I hace much I guess?<br>
	 Melissa- Haha, of course you don't. This is what Doctress gives us. Only her blood works.<br>
	 Florence- Oh...<br>
	 Melissa- Do you know the rarety and power of guns?<br>
	 Florence- Yep. E, B, A, S, SS and SSS.<br>
	 Melissa- Yeah. The weapons her gave to us is all SSS.<br>
	 Florence- What? Isn't it supposed to destroy a planet?<br>
	 Melissa- Yes, the larger ones. Ours can do the same, but against a population of a planet also.<br>
	 Florence- Wow, she must really be badass<br>
	 Melissa- Only marshals starting at 3 stars are supposed to have these. You can immagine how difficult is to hands on<br>
	 in a thing like this. Yet she gaves us like it's nothing. Rather, she herself said it's nothing!<br>
	 Florence- What the hell, so what is something to her?<br>
	 Melissa- Well, she said it's just a copy, so it could give "enough firepower to ten planets"<br><br>
	<center>
	 	<font size="2" style="font-family: cursive;">
	 		What she has in beauty she has the same of scary in many different ways...
	 	</font>
	</center>
	<br>
	Florence- I'll keep in mind to never piss her<br>
	Melissa- Hahaha, I think you should. She already have taken and entire Order alone.<br>
	Florence- What do you mean? The first?<br>
	Melissa- Of course no. It was the ninth. After Jonathan's choices, the Number themselves could choose their apprentices.<br> The eighth just didn't a good decision with theirs. At certain moment one of 'em tryied to harass her and she<br>
	broke his finger and left knee.<br><br>
	<center>
	 	<font size="2" style="font-family: cursive;">
	 		I reaaaaaaaaally won't piss her off
	 	</font>
	</center>
	<br>
	 Melissa- But this was just an excuse to be expelled from Nightmare. They were complaining so much about the issue she agreed.<br>
	 They were planning on change sides and go to the Kingdom and sell Nightmare and make her their "blood source".<br>
	 Florence- ...<br>
	 Melissa- Maybe something more. These types exist everywhere.<br>
	 Florence- ... Yeah. Maybe I'm not to surprised anymore<br>
	 Melissa- ... Cough, but she asked the guns and other weapons back, since she didn't want 'em in outsiders hands.<br>
	 They resisted and nine of them tried to take her life away, since they couldn't leave quietly.<br>
	 Florence- Nine?
	 Melissa- Five Numbers and four apprentices. They used their weapons, but... were all destroyed in a moment.<br>
	 Florence- What? Just like this?<br>
	 Melissa- Yeah, the only one who tried to stop them know nothing too.<br>
	 Florence- Who he was?<br>
	 Melissa- The Third of the Tenth Order.<br>
	 Florence- What? But only remained him, right? Why not the first?<br>
	 Melissa- Us Numbers are not defined by ranking power or authority. The only here is that all of us are under Jonathan and Doctress.<br>It is just to say which weapon we have compatibility. We also need that besides Doctress blood.<br>
	 Florence- Oh...<br>
	 Melissa- But normaly is Chandler after me who gives the orders, but we act and decide like a team, not separated by functions.<br>
	 Florence- [Eating again]<br>
	 Melissa- Well, in the end you don't need to do anything really.<br>
	 Florence- Am I that worthless?<br>
	 Melissa- Is not what I mean...<br>
	 Florence- I know you don't want me to be a part of it. Every one one you has a past with the Kingdom and...<br>
	 Melissa- Chandler told you about it?<br>
	 Florence- !... Yeah<br>
	 Melissa- Bet he did hahaha<br>
	 Florence- ...If I may...<br>
	 Melissa- ...<br>
	 Florence- Eh... oh, by the way, how was I chosen by you?<br>
	 Melissa- Ah, we... eh...<br>
	 Florence- ?<br>
	 Melissa- You know, we are actually the Eleventh Order<br>
	 Florence- ??<br>
	 Melissa- The Tenth was annihilated when of oh them betrayed the rest. I don't know if it's because of that, but "Jonathan is choosing this one personally". That's what Doctress said.<br>
	 Florence- Oh... so everyone here known each other recently?<br>
	 Melissa- Nope. Jonathan were choosing since seven years ago. You, now, were the last. The first was I myself, the second one, Chandler. After, James, Lisa and Emilia in that order.<br>
	 Florence- A decent time to know each other, I'd say<br>
	 Melissa- Chandler and I, James and Lisa were already acquaintances before here, tho.<br>
	 Florence- Oh, They seemed quite close, in fact. But when you decided to not involve me?<br>
	 Melissa- It was Chandler's suggestion. It may not appear, but he cares a lot about all of us, and others too.<br>
	 Florence- I didn't have imagined<br><br>

	 	<font size="2" style="font-family: cursive;">
	 		It really doesn't.
	 	</font>
	</center>
	<br>
	 Melissa- All of us have agreed on that, so there is no problem if you don't want to risk your life in something like this.<br> It is indeed a hard choice, anyway.<br>
	 Florence- Don't mind that. I really liked you guys, and... furthermore...

	 		The multitude beat us. They hated us. They even cooperated with a false justice.<br>
	 		They were very demons in our life. <b>So what</b>? Anyone will do anything?<br>
	 		Nay, they probably  like it, nobody says a thing, so why would they?<br>
	 		Almost none knows the truth, right? so--

	<br>
	Melissa- Florence?<br>
	Florence- !... Oh, sorry Melissa<br>
	Melissa- It's okay. Are you alright?
	Florence- Yeah...<br>
	Melissa- ... Well, if you really wanna do something, why don't I show you something to do?<br>
	Florence- Hn? Like what?<br>
	Melissa- What type of things do you like to do?<br>
	Florence- Hm... we'll find something<br>
	Melissa- Okay!

		- How's David's gradson?<br>
		Doctress- Still no signal of old memories.<br>

		- Roger<br>
		Doctress- And about you, Jonathan? When will you be back? Where are you? It's so much work to do...<br>
