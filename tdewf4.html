	Doctress- Okay, first you tell me to command 'em to pick up Damian. Okay?<br>
	Jonathan- Yeah...<br>
	Doctress- Then I did that. And I thought you just wanted the core!<br>
	Jonathan- Well, that was the original idea<br>
	Doctress- ... yeah, and?<br>
	Jonathan- Before his death, I talked to David.<br>
	Doctress- You've got soft, Jonathan<br>
	Jonathan- That is also your fault, you know? [Smiling]<br>
	Doctress- <b>Go on.</b> [Sulky]<br>
	Jonathan- Sigh. He knew we wouldn't be able to protect his family. He predicted, as well as we all did, that the Kingdom would<br>chase after 'em. He said to me not to kill Damian, knowing we could not gave the Kingdom our tools.<br>Well, he predicted right, I really wanted to kill dat boy as soon as possible now. But he did a bet with me.<br>
	Doctress- Or rather, you knew he fused his with Daniela's core?<br>
	Jonathan- Yeah.<br>
	Doctress- So they..<br>
	Jonathan- They were trying to protect at least their household.<br>
	Doctress- But still about Damian...<br>
	Jonathan- Yeah. We know what happened to 'im. So, going on, as you asked, the bet was about Damian's choices<br>
	Doctress- David did something?<br>
	Jonathan- Hah, of course not! That naivee boi only have socialization abilities. I projected everything.<br>
	Doctress- Why did you accept'd?<br>
	Jonathan- I wanna see the porficiency he will have with that gun. Also I decided to go slowly, showin' 'em the things<br>
	which happened because of the Kingdom's actions or something. After that we'll decide if we kill, or we let 'him live. Okay?<br>
	Doctress- But Jon, We cannot control his. What if he--<br>
	Jonathan- Calm down, little girl. I am here, you know<br>
	Doctress- I'm like this because you're not, you know?<br>

    	[-oJ_K2]: HM .. .<br>

    	[-oJ_K2]: .. .<br>
    	[-sD_K1]: I KNOW YOUR REASONS WERE DIFFERENT THOUGH! HAHAHA<br>
    	[-oJ_K2]: I DO NOT GLORY ON MY OWN SELFISHNESS, DAVID .<br>
		[-sD_K1]: HAHAHAHA. WELL, SO WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT ?<br>
    	[-oJ_K2]: THEY'LL FIND OUT LITERALLY IN NO TIME SOPHIE IS NOT THE SIXTH .<br>
    	[-sD_K1]: .. .<br>
    	[-oJ_K2]: SO THEY'LL GO AFTER YOUR GRANDSON, OBVIOUSLY .<br>
    	[-sD_K1]: THEY DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIME.. .<br>
    	[-oJ_K2]: THEY'LL JUST KILL EVERYONE AND WAIT FOR ONE TO WAKE UP, DAVID .<br>
